Field Metabolic Rates (FMR) in Seabirds

We want to make predictions of FMR.

We always know: mass, latitude, animal (phylogenetic position), colony size, phase
We might know: site and species (may move between random and fixed effects)
Always random: animal (to account for non-independence and to make predictions for unknown species using phylogenetic information)
Why is 'phase' special? Because we always want to konw if it's important/ what the value is so that we always have a value in mind.
